  <h1 id="title">[EDITOR'S DRAFT] Verifiable Claims Working Group Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

      <p class="mission">The mission of the Verifiable Claims Working Group is to make expressing, exchanging, and verifying claims easier and more secure on the Web. Please review the <a href="vcwg-draft.html">draft charter</a> if you have not already done so.</p>

  <h2 id="problem">What problem is this work attempting to address?</h2>

   <p>
There is currently no widely used user-centric and privacy-enhancing standard
for expressing and transacting verifiable claims (aka: credentials,
attestations) via the Web.
   </p>
   <p>
These problems exist today:
   </p>
   <ul>
       <li>
There is no standard that makes it easy for users to assert their verifiable
qualifications to a service provider (e.g. my loyalty card number is X, I
have an account at Bank Y, I am over the age of 21, I am a citizen of the USA,
I am a Chartered Financial Analyst, etc.). As a result, manual input and
fraud on the Web are higher than desired.
       </li>
       <li>
In existing attribute exchange architectures (like SAML, OpenID Connect, Login
with SuperProviderX, etc.), users, and their verifiable claims, do not
independently exist from service providers. This means users can't easily
change their service provider without losing their digital identity. This
leads to vendor lock-in, identity fragility, reduced competition in the
marketplace, and reduced privacy for all stakeholders.
       </li>
       <li>
There is no interoperable standard capable of expressing and transmitting
rich verifiable claims that cuts across industries (e.g., finance, retail,
education, and healthcare). This leads to industry-specific solutions that
are costly, inefficient, proprietary, and inhibit users' ability to manage
their digital identities in a cohesive way.
       </li>
   </ul>

  <h2 id="real-problem">Is there agreement that this is a problem?</h2>

    <p>
Forty-three (43) organizations that either issue verifiable claims or
consume verifiable claims were surveyed to determine their needs in this space.
Extensive interviews were conducted among industry experts that have worked
in this space over the past 15 years. A Community Group of 77 people have
been incubating this work for almost 2 years. There is general consensus
that this is a problem that should be, and can be, addressed.
    </p>

    <p>
There is a <a href="VCTF-final-report.html">Verifiable Claims Final Report</a> summarizing the
findings and consensus around the problem statement.
    </p>

  <h2 id="requirements">What kind of requirements have been identified for a user-centric, privacy-enhancing verifiable claims ecosystem?</h2>

<p>
A user-centric, privacy-enhancing, verifiable claims ecosystem is defined as having the following requirements:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The subject (e.g. a user) of a verifiable claim has independent existence; users can control and own their identifiers.</li>
  <li>Verifiable claims are a mechanism for transferring the trust issuers have in users to third parties; the trust model does not directly involve software agents or services.</li>
  <li>Users may ask issuers to make verifiable claims about them. Users can be given these claims in digital form, store them at a location of their choosing, and control with whom they are shared.</li>
  <li>Users may decide how to aggregate claims and manage their own digital identities.</li>
  <li>Users may use software agents to help them store claims, but these agents are not party to the claims; users may freely change agents without losing or affecting the meaning of their claims.</li>
  <li>Users may share verifiable claims without revealing the intended recipient to the software agent they use to store the claims.</li>
  <li>Consumers of verifiable claims may independently verify them without revealing their identity to the issuers of the claims.</li>
  <li>Users may be guaranteed basic unlinkability when sharing pseudo-anonymous verifiable claims with multiple parties.</li>
  <li>Semantics are decentralized. Vocabularies for verifiable claims may evolve independently in the communities that use them. Issuers may use these to indicate the meaning of their verifiable claims.</li>
  <li>Trust is decentralized. Consumers of verifiable claims decide which issuers to trust.</li>
</ul>

  <h2 id="user-centric">What is meant by "user-centric"?</h2>

  <p>
In a <strong id="user-centric">user-centric</strong> system, users exist
independently from services. To contrast, in a service centric system
users are tightly bound to a particular service.
  </p>

   <p>
A verifiable claims ecosystem that is <a href="#user-centric">user-centric</a>
has the following qualities:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
Users are positioned in the middle between claims issuers and
claims inspectors.
    </li>
    <li>
Users receive and store verifiable claims from issuers through an agent that
the issuer does not need to trust.
    </li>
    <li>
Users provide verifiable claims to inspectors through an agent that inspectors
needn't trust; they only need to trust issuers.
    </li>
    <li>
Verifiable claims are associated with users, not particular services; users
can decide how to aggregate claims and manage their own digital identities.
    </li>
    <li>
Users can control and own their own identifiers.
    </li>
    <li>
Users can control which verifiable claims to use and when.
    </li>
    <li>
Users may freely choose and swap out the agents they employ to help them
manage and share their verifiable claims.
    </li>
    <li>
Does not require users that share verifiable claims to reveal the identity of
the consumer to their agent or to issuers.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="service-centric">What is meant by "service-centric"?</h2>

    <p>
A <strong id="service-centric">service-centric</strong> system, users
are tightly bound to services. To contrast, in a user-centric
system, users exist independently from services.
    </p>

    <p>
A verifiable claims ecosystem that is
<a href="#service-centric">service-centric</a> (LDAP, SAML, OpenID Connect) has
the following qualities:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
Services are positioned in the middle between issuers, users, and consumers.
      </li>
      <li>
Users receive and store verifiable claims from issuers through an agent that
the issuer must trust, or they must be the same entity.
      </li>
      <li>
Users provide verifiable claims to consumers through an agent that consumers
must trust.
      </li>
      <li>
Verifiable claims must be associated with services, fracturing a user's
digital identity potentially against their desire.
      </li>
      <li>
Services control and own their user's identifiers.
      </li>
      <li>
User's verifiable claims are locked in agent silos.
      </li>
      <li>
Requires users that share verifiable claims to reveal the identity of the
consumer to their agent and issuers.
      </li>
      <li>
Consumers may have to register with user's agents to consume verifiable claims.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h2 id="saml-openid">How is this work different from LDAP, SAML, or OpenID Connect?</h2>

  <p>
LDAP, SAML, and OpenID Connect are attribute exchange systems that are
service-centric. The proposed work is attempting to create a user-centric,
privacy-enhancing system, but there is overlap.
  </p>

  <p>
The proposed work is focusing first on data formats, vocabularies, and
syntaxes for the expression of verifiable claims. If successful, the
work could be re-used via SAML and OpenID Connect-based systems (and,
in fact, a document explaining how that should happen is one of the
proposed outputs of the group).
  </p>

  <h2 id="protocol">Why isn't work on a privacy-enhancing attribute exchange protocol in the charter?</h2>

  <p>
Attribute exchange protocols such as SAML and OpenID Connect exist and it
is unclear if those protocols could address the problem statement or not.
So, working on a protocol was controversial as some asserted that the protocol
is a solved problem while others asserted that a new protocol would be
necessary. There was, however, no real controversy around a data model,
vocabularies, and syntax(es) for the expression of verifiable claims. It
may be that this output could be married with existing attribute exchange
systems to achieve a solution to the problem statement noted earlier in the
FAQ. If not, work on a new privacy-enhancing attribute exchange protocol
may be suggested by the yet-to-be created Working Group.
