    A <em>verifiable claim</em> is a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece of
    information about an <a>entity's</a> background such as a name, government ID,
    payment provider, home address, or university degree.
    The use cases outlined here are provided in order to make progress toward
    possible future standardization and interoperability of both low and
    high-stakes <a>claims</a> with the goals of storing, transmitting, and receiving
    digitally verifiable proof of attributes such as qualifications and achievements.
    The use cases in this document focus on concrete scenarios that the technology defined
    by the group should address.
    </p>
</section>

<section id='sotd'>
    <p>This document represents a concise but limited collection of use cases readers should review in
    conjunction with the proposed Charter for a Verifiable Claims Working Group.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <!-- Editor - @halindrome -->
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    The Verifiable Claims Task Force of the Web Payments Interest and
    Credentials Community Groups at the W3C is investigating
    the requirements around secure, verifiable, and richly descriptive
    "<a>claims</a>".  The goal of the Task Force is to determine if
    there is a sufficient understanding and need to merit the creation
    of a W3C Working Group to develop Recommendations in this space.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
        This document does NOT attempt to define an architecture for
        the support of Verifiable Claims.  Instead it expresses the sorts 
        of needs that real users have that could be addressed through support
        for some sort of user oriented claim environment.  It attempts to use
        terminology that is consistent with the other deliverables of the
        Verifiable Claims Task Force (you can see a summary of these terms
        in Appendix A).
    </div>
    <section>
        <h3>Importance of this Work</h3>

        <p>People need to make many kinds of claims as part of their
        everyday lives.
        As more important business moves to the Internet, people need
        to be able to transmit instantly <em>verifiable</em> claims about their
        accomplishments and qualifications. From educational records
        to payment account access, the next generation of web
        applications will authorize users to perform actions based on
        rich sets of credentials issued by trusted parties.
        Human-mediated decisions about job applications, collaboration,
        and professional development will depend on filtering and
        analyzing growing amounts of data about individuals'
        experience and accomplishments.
        </p>
        <p>Standardization of digital <a>claim</a> technologies makes it
        possible for many stakeholders to issue, earn, and trust these
        essential records about their counterparties, without being
        locked into proprietary platforms.</p>

    <p>Instead of a traditional, tech-centric approach to presenting user stories, this document 
    embraces the point of view of the User.  To that end, this section is organized by
    industry verticals / uses and the needs of people in those categories.</p>

            <h4>F.1 Reuse Know Your Customer</h4>
            Jane would like to get a digitally signed <a>credential</a> for her
            checking account at MidBank. MidBank offers to provide a
            credential asserting that Jane has an account at MidBank and
            has access to her associated checking account. MidBank has
            performed &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; clearing (driverâ€™s license,
            background check, anti-money laundering blackslist check,
            etc.), on Jane which she can use at other financial
            institutions. This can help Jane assure destination banks that
            she is verified, thereby allaying concerns about misdirected
            transactions and money laundering.

            Susan wants to send funds to her family in another country via a
            popular money transfer service.  She has <a>verifiable claims</a> in her
            <a>credential repository</a> that can be used to share her <a>identity profile</a>.  
            She has also been
            sent a <a>claim</a> from her family verifying their banking information.  
            By sharing these with the money transfer service, they can
            automatically verify the source and destination of funds, thus being
            confident in the delivery of those funds and satisfying various
            regulations regarding prevention of money laundering.

            John opens a checking account at Big Bank Co and is issued a Verifiable Claim
            indicating that the account exists, that the bank verified John's identity, and that
            John has access to the account.  Some time later, John is moving to a new city and
            decides to close that account.  Big Bank Co needs to revoke that claim as part of their
            normal account closing process.

            brokerage account with WallStreetCo.  She had placed all of her claims
            in a <a>credential repository</a> at BigBank that came free
            when she opened her accounts.  WallStreetCo is now offering a new
            <a>repository</a> that has an interface she thinks she will prefer.  
            Nikita copies
            her claims from BigBank into the repository at WallStreetCo to
            experiment with their service, but continues to use the service
            from BigBank while she is testing.

            BigOnlineBank offers the ability to do this from home if she can
            provide electronic credentials.  She offers government issued
            certificates that verify her identity (address, national identity
            number, etc.), and opens her new account from her couch.

            her office, is responsible for the integrity, accuracy, and
            security of academic records.  Joleen has been a pioneering
            registrar in advocating an 'extended transcript' that includes not
            only the standard set of course grades but also adds supplementary
            information on learner competencies.  These might include work
            experiences and non-educational but marketable skills. Upon the
            request of her students Joleen issues digital credentials that
            encapsulates an extended transcript.

            Eunice is about to take her ACT (a test used to evaluate her readiness for
            college).  When she arrives at the testing center, she is required to present
            identification.  Her government-issued identity certificate
            is acceptable, as the <a>verifiable claims</a> 
            contained in it reflect all of the required attributes and it is impossible to counterfeit.

            Rocky is an undergraduate student at Wossamotta U.  His school
                provides a credential repository service to all students and alumni,
                so he chooses to use it.  In his third year, Rocky decides to
                transfer to Moosylvania Tech.  They do not offer a service, but
                he does not want to continue to use the service of his old (and
                now rival school) so he moves his claims to the 
                service offered by his bank without needing to have them
                reissued.

            In MOOC and other on-line learning systems, being able

            individual evaluation and certification. Nick is participating in
            a course online and takes a test.  
            He is required to provide his
            credentials to prove his identity before the test, and
            then to allow the system to issue a <a>verifiable claim</a> regarding the results of
            his test.

            Barney is a physician, and has recently become board certified in his state.
            The state's board issues Barney a digital certificate confirming that he is certified
            to practice medicine in that state.  Barney can now use this certificate when writing
            prescriptions and referrals, thereby improving accountability and verifiability.

            iPharmacy receives a prescription for Bob electronically from a local
            clinic.  It includes a certificate about the physician that issued
            the prescription as well as one about Bob.  iPharmacy's
            system automatically verifies the ability of the physician to
            write prescriptions, as well as Bob's insurance coverage.
            When Bob arrives to pick up his medication, iPharmacy
            further correlates his identity with the certificate, thereby
            improving the end-to-end accountability of their system.

            her health care network and goes in for treatment.  She is a new patient, so the 
            clinic needs to know who she is and how she will be paying.  When checking in, she 
            presents her verifiable claim that demonstrates her identity and her proof of
            insurance.  When the clinc submits this to the insurance company, they can 
            automatically ascertain that she submitted her proof of identity and insurance to the provider
            and granted the physician the ability to submit the claim for payment.

            visits a health clinic in a country in which he does not live.
            At the clinic he is
            asked for proof of identity.  He provides a credential that
            verifies his name and address, but elects not to disclose his
            marital status nor his social security number, as those are
            neither requested nor required at this clinic. He further marks
            the disclosure as expiring in 30 days - he does not want his
            information verifiable after that time.

            Education's Accreditation Database. Jane's credential is

            visible when she posts messages. 
            Josie authorizes the sharing of the relevant claims with the

            allowing Josie to expose them.

            evaluates these credentials automatically as they receive her
            application.  Because her materials are verifiable and verified,
            her application is immediately forwarded as a viable
            candidate.

            Tom is a frequent international traveler.  In order to speed processing
            through immigration check points, he applies for a digital passport from 
            his governmental authority.  After satisfying background check requirements, 
            the authority issues Tom an electronic version of his passport.  This 
            version is verifiable and retains a history of all the places he visits so
            that immigration officials can quickly and easily evaluate his suitability as a
            visitor to their country.  Once they are satisfied, the will automatically add the
            details of this new visit to Tom's passport.

            Security for air travel is more and more rigorous, requiring more and more time to validate
            each passenger.  Ivan has a collection of verifiable claims that are assembed into his 
            air travel <a>Identity Profile</a>.  When Ivan needs to pass through a security checkpoint at his airport, 
            he presents this profile before entering the line.  Because his identification can be immediately and automatically
            verified, he is permitted to skip the long line and go straight to the metal detector.

            <h4>L.4 Refugee Crisis</h4>
            Thousands of people each year are displaced because of man-made and natural disasters.  Anoushka is one such, 
            having been forced to flee her village along with her mother and younger brother. They 
            reach an IFRC center just across the broder in a relatively
            safe area, but with no documentation.  Since the government of her homeland is in turmoil, there is no way for the IFRC staff
            to easilty establish their identities. Fortunately, Anoushka had been issued a self-soverign proof of birth, attached to which
            is the proof of birth and marriage for her parents.  She is able to retrieve this because it is available from many places on
            the Internet.  Since it is verifiable, the IFRC is comfortable vouching for them and resettling them in a safer area for the
            duration of the conflict.

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>These examples describe basic ways in which Verifiable Claims 
    might be used.  They are not meant to be architecturally constraining. Instead,
    they are meant to help illustrate the basic way it <em>could</em> be done in a
    typical commerce situation.
    Again - please remember that it is just an
    example, and should not be thought of as the canonical way such
    a claims environment must be implemented.</p>
    <section>
        <h2>How a Verifiable Claim Might be Created</h2>
        <p>In this first example, a user will request a Verifiable Claim - a
        confirmation of their identity. Consider this illustration:</p>

        <img alt='Verifiable Claim Creation Flow Description' style='display:block; margin:auto' src="uc-issuing-claims.svg"/>
        <p>Expanding on these steps:</p>
        <ol title="Verifiable Claim Creation Flow Description">
            <li>Jane asks her User Agent to help her get a Verifiable Claim about
            her identity.</li>
            <li>Her user agent connects her to a certificate issuer that is able
            to verify her identity.</li>
            <li>The issuer examines her documentation.</li>
            <li>They are satisfied, so the issuer generates a Verifiable Claim for
            Jane that includes information about her identity linked to their
            own trusted <em>credential</em>.</li>
            <li>The issuer delivers the credential back to Jane's User Agent.</li>
            <li>Jane views the credential to ensure it reflects her
            requirements.</li>
            <li>When she is satisfied, she instructs her User Agent to save the
            Verifiable Claim so she can use it in the future.</li>
            <li>The UA communicates with her <a>Credential Repository</a>,
            instructing it to store the new claim.</li>
            <li>The <a>Credential Repository</a> returns a list of the claims it is
            holding for Jane to the UA.</li>
            <li>The UA shows Jane her claim collection - confirming 
            everything she has available.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>How a Verifiable Claim Might be Used</h2>
        <p>In this example, a <a>holder</a> of a claim needs to use that claim in a
        typical commerce situation:</p>
        <img aria-describedby="vf-flow" alt='Verifiable Claim Usage Flow Diagram' style='display:block; margin:auto' src="example.svg"/>
        <ol title="Verifiable Claim Usage Flow Description" id="vf-flow">
            <li>Jane decides to shop on the web site
            WinesOfTheWorld.example.com (merchant).</li>
            <li>The merchant's site requires Jane be 21 years of age and
            requests Jane prove this (via a user agent-supported API call).</li>
            <li>Jane's user agent asks her <a>credential repository</a> for the
            proof.</li>
            <li>The <a>credential repository</a> shows Jane three Verifiable Claims
            it knows of that
            can assert this claim (e.g., her passport, driving
            license, and birth certificate).</li>
            <li>Jane selects one of these and authorizes that it be
            shared with the merchant.</li>
            <li>The <a>credential repository</a> returns the selected claim as a response
            to the user agent-supported API call, which in turn delivers
            it to the merchant.</li>
            <li>The merchant's server verifies that the claim is valid
            and satisfies the requirement.</li>
            <li>The merchant redirects the user agent to the web site
            with appropriate authorization.</li>
