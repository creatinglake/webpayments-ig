  <h1 id="title">Demonstration of Support for Verifiable Claims Working Group</h1>

  <p>
The Verifiable Claims Task Force performed a
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wS32QHfxeqVu32LyZt57fVjqnywdET2ytLcaHhVxbFY/viewform#response=ACYDBNiImmymqAO5UEbq7zGYerp3FGCu_cK-2C_ok7pCb5QK4eByQtyD2zRkCTs">survey</a>
among 91 organizations to determine if the Verifiable Claims Working Group
proposal had industry support. The response rate to the informal review of the
Verifiable Claims work was 62% (high for an optional survey), with 56
organizations responding to the survey.
  <p>
A summary of the findings follow, with detailed aggregate statistics for each
question and response throughout the rest of this document. Raw data is
available as
