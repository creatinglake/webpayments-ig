  <h1 id="title">[EDITOR'S DRAFT] Proposed Verifiable Claims Architecture</h1>

  <p>
A <strong>self-sovereign</strong> architecture for verifiable claims is one
where the holder of a verifiable claim is in complete control of their
identifier, where their verifiable claims are stored, and how they are used.
There is currently no widely used self-sovereign, privacy-enhancing standard
for expressing and transacting verifiable claims (aka: credentials,
attestations) via the Web. This a summary of a proposed architecture to
address part of this problem.
  </p>

  <h2>Proposed Verifiable Claims Architecture Goals</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
Create a standard way for users to assert their verifiable qualifications to a
service provider in a way that reduces fraud and enhances website
usability by removing the need to manually enter verifiable claims.
    </li>
    <li>
Ensure that holders and their verifiable claims may be independent from
service providers.
    </li>
    <li>
Ensure that there is an interoperable standard capable of expressing
verifiable claims that works in the same way across different market
verticals.
    </li>
    <li>
Re-use existing attribute-exchange protocols or create new protocols that are
capable of transmitting the data in a privacy-enhancing way.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Architecture Terminology</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong><em>Verifiable Claim</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
A claim that can be cryptographically proven to be non-repudiable, authentic,
and unaltered by bad actors.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Holders</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Receive verifiable claims from issuers, store them at repositories that
they trust, and provide them to inspectors in order to get access to
protected resources.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Issuers</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Provide verifiable claims to holders.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Inspectors</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Request verifiable claims from holders in order to give them access to
protected resources.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Repositories</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Store and curate verifiable claims on behalf of holders.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Decentralized Identifier Registry</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
A decentralized registry that enables users to register self-sovereign
identifiers such that the user is ultimately in control of the identifier.
This is in contrast to most identifier systems today where the identifier is
rented or leased from an authority (domain name system, email system,
proprietary service username, etc.).
