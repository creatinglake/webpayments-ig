  <h1 id="title">[EDITOR'S DRAFT] Proposed Verifiable Claims Architecture</h1>

  <p>
A <strong>self-sovereign</strong> architecture for verifiable claims is one
where the holder of a verifiable claim is in complete control of their
identifier, where their verifiable claims are stored, and how they are used.
There is currently no widely used self-sovereign, privacy-enhancing standard
for expressing and transacting verifiable claims (aka: credentials,
attestations) via the Web. This a summary of an architecture that aspires to
address part of this problem.
  </p>

  <h2 id="goals">Proposed Verifiable Claims Architecture Goals</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Enhance website usability by removing the need to manually enter verifiable claims</li>
    <li>Reduce fraud by creating a standard way to share verifiable qualifications</li>
    <li>Ensure maximum privacy in claims sharing mechanism</li>
    <li>Separate production and control of an identifier from the production of claims associated with the identifier</li>
    <li>Separate control of claims sharing from creation of claims</li>
    <li>Develop standards for interactions between architectural roles, independent of market vertical</li>
    <li>Re-use existing protocols where appropriate</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="basic-architecture">Basic Architecture Block Diagram</h2>

  <p>
A basic architecture for verifiable claims must distinguish the essential
roles of core actors and the relationships between then; how do they interact?
A role is an abstraction that might be implemented in many different ways. The
separation of roles suggests likely interfaces and/or protocols for
standardization. The basic verifiable claims architecture separates the
basis for identification, the generation of claims associated with an
identifier, and the processes for managing and using claims:

  </figure>
  <p>
Although claims mechanisms already exist, they suffer a
number of inherent limitations, mostly caused by tight integration between
the production of an identifier and the production of claims, and/or the
production of claims and the storage of claims. The proposed basic architecture
decouples the production of an identifier, the production of claims, and the
storage/usage of claims. This ensures a more modular, flexible, and
competitive ecosystem.

  <h3 id="basic-terminology">Basic Architecture Terminology</h3>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong><em>Claim</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
A statement made by an entity about a subject. For example: "Jane is a doctor."
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Verifiable Claim</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
A Claim that can be cryptographically proven to be non-repudiable, authentic,
and unaltered by bad actors.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Subject</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
The entity that a verifiable claim is about.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Holder</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Obtain verifiable claims from an Issuer and selectively provide them to
Requesters. The Holder is often, but not always, the Subject of the claims.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Issuer</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Provide verifiable claims to Holders.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Requester</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Request verifiable claims from Holders in order to give them access to
protected resources.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Identifier Registry</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Mediate creation and verification of globally-unique identifiers
    </dd>
  </dl>


  <h2 id="enhanced-architecture">Enhanced Architecture Block Diagram</h2>

  <p>
The basic architecture separates identifier management from claims management.
Services such as the Domain Name System (DNS) demonstrate that an independent
identifier service is feasible and scalable. The enhanced architecture permits
exploration of the nascent "self-sovereign identifier" concept that is
essential in some scenarios and some environments. It further decouples
delegation of claims storage from claims management and provides for claims
evaluation to be a separate service from an entity that uses the results of
the evaluation.

  <dl>
    <dt><strong><em>Repository</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Store and curate verifiable claims on behalf of Holders.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Inspector</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Evaluate the validity of claims using complex business logic, if necessary.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Decentralized Identifier Registry</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
A registry that enables Subjects to register identifiers that are not
dependent upon a government or any specific service provider. This permits the
owner/administrator of the identifier to be self-sovereign about its use. This
is in contrast to systems that merely lease use of the identifier
(domain name system, email system, proprietary service username, etc.).
