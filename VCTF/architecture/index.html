  <h1 id="title">[EDITOR'S DRAFT] Proposed Verifiable Claims Architecture</h1>

  <p>
<strong>self-sovereign</strong> - an architectural principle where the holder
of a verifiable claim is in complete control of their identifier and
where their verifiable claims are stored.
  </p>

  <p>
There is currently no widely used self-sovereign, privacy-enhancing
standard for expressing and transacting verifiable claims (aka:
credentials, attestations) via the Web. This a summary of a proposed
architecture to address part of this problem.
  </p>

  <h2>Proposed Verifiable Claims Architecture Goals</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
Create a standard way for users to assert their verifiable qualifications to a
service provider in a way that reduces fraud and enhances website
usability by removing the need to manually enter verifiable claims.
    </li>
    <li>
Ensure that holders and their verifiable claims may be independent from
service providers.
    </li>
    <li>
Ensure that there is an interoperable standard capable of expressing
verifiable claims that works in the same way across different market
verticals.
    </li>
    <li>
Re-use existing attribute-exchange protocols or create new protocols that are
capable of transmitting the data in a privacy-enhancing way.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Architecture Terminology</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong><em>Verifiable Claim</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
A claim that can be cryptographically proven to be non-repudiable, authentic,
and unaltered by bad actors.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Issuers</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Provide verifiable claims to people and organizations.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Repositories</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Store and curate verifiable claims on behalf of people and organizations.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Inspectors</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Request verifiable claims from people and organizations in order to give
them access to protected resources.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Holders</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Receive verifiable claims from issuers, store them at repositories that
they trust, and provide them to inspectors in order to get access to
protected resources.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><em>Decentralized Identifier Registry</em></strong></dt>
    <dd>
Decentralized Identifiers are the mechanism by which users are able to
control their identifiers. They store self-sovereign identifier documents
for the purpose of claiming self-sovereign identifiers, updating the basic
management information associated with a self-sovereign identifier, and
verifying the cryptographic authenticity of verifiable claims associated
with a self-sovereign identifiers.
